# CrowdAssist

An assistant for Bug Bounty Researchers to help with report writing on Bugcrowd.

## Features

CrowdAssist offers two main features to streamline your workflow.

### Username Mentions

Quickly mention researchers and Bugcrowd staff in comments by typing `@` followed by their name. A helpful tooltip will appear to autocomplete the username.

## Privacy Note

This extension enhances your workflow by reading public usernames directly from the submission's activity feed. It does this by looking for specific HTML tags (`span.owner-name[data-tooltip-id]`) and does not read or store any other data from the page. The full source code is available in `content.js` for auditing.
